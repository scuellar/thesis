Explaining the main theorem:

Assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline{CSL_correct C_program}: States that the program has been proven correct in CSL, 
as described in  [section CSL ref] %TODO reference

\item \lstinline{CompCert_compiler}: States that the CompCert compiler translates 
\lstinline{C_program} into the assembly program \lstinline{Asm_program}.  

\item \lstinline{CSL_init_setup}:  States that \lstinline{src_m} and \lstinline{src_cpm} are the initial 
memory and state as defined by the program \lstinline{C_program}... According to CSL

\item \lstinline{Clight.entry_point }: Same as above... According to Clight. %TODO

\item \lstinline{limited_builtins}: Statically checkable property stating that \lstinline{Asm_program} 
doesn't have unsupported builtins.

\item \lstinline{asm_prog_well_formed}: Another statically checkable property stating that the initial 
memory and global environment created by \lstinline{Asm_program} are well formed.
\end{itemize}

Conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline{permissionless_init_machine}: There exists initial memories and state for \lstinline{Asm_program}

\item \lstinline{spinlock_safe}: The initial state is safe and "spinlock well synchronized"
as defined in [reference to spinlock]% Check how this is defnied  

\end{itemize}

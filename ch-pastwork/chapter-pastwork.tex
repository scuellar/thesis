In this section we review related work, paying special attention to the developments that bear technical similarities to ours. 

Boehm wrote ``Threads cannot be implemented as a library,''
\cite{boehm05}
explaining that many compilers did optimizations that were unsafe
for concurrency. He argued that better language specifications
were needed.  This motivated our work.
Our new result shows that CompCert's specification
(with our improvements relating to permissions and events)
\emph{does} permit threads to be implemented
``as a library'', in the sense that it decouples the
compiler-correctness proof from the thread-library correctness
proof.

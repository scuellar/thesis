%\section{Concurrency Models}
%\label{sec:concurmodel}
%
%There is a large body of work on concurrency models for verification GOT TO CITE THEM ALL but, to the best of our knowledge, none has ever been connected to a verified optimizing compiler yet. Bellow we highlight some models that are related to our treatment of concurrency in the compiler proof.
%
%Memarian \emph{et al.}  \cite{memarian16} specify the C language with
%atomic memory operations, but the spec is not connected to an
%optimizing compiler, nor to a program logic for reasoning about
%correctness, data-race-freedom, or any such safety property of source
%programs.

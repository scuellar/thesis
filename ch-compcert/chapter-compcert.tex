\chapter{Making Compcert a \emph{concjunctive} compiler }\label{ch:compcert}

The simple code in \ref{example:remember} communicates with its environment in two main ways: (1) it takes an address as input and (2) reads from and writes to this location to increment the value stored there.
\begin{table}\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, numbers=left]
int *buff;
void remember(int *p){
    buff = p;
}
void incr(void){
    ++(*buff);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The function \Ccode{remember} records the address of some buffer, and \Ccode{incr} increments it by one. }
\label{example:remember}
\end{table}
We will see how the specifications of CompCert prevents us from reasoning about such program as compilation units and as external functions and we will present solutions to these limitations.

First, CompCert can't give any guarantees about compiling the code in \ref{example:remember} because it is not a complete program. It is reasonable to expect that the function \Ccode{remember} runs safely, given some assumptions (e.g. \Ccode{*p} is a valid address in memory). Unfortunately, CompCert's semantics assumes that a program starts executing with a call to  \Ccode{main()} with no arguments. In fact, the only possible initial states, are characterized by a predicate \Coqcode{initial_state: state -> Prop} that takes no additional arguments. You can see an instantiation of the predicate for Clight in \ref{code:initial_state}. So, even though CompCert correctly compiles the code, it's specification gives no guarantees of any execution other than the one that starts by calling main with no arguments.
\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}
Inductive initial_state (p: program): state -> Prop :=
  | initial_state_intro: forall b f m0,
      let ge := Genv.globalenv p in
      Genv.init_mem p = Some m0 ->
      Genv.find_symbol ge p.(prog_main) = Some b ->
      Genv.find_funct_ptr ge b = Some f ->
      type_of_fundef f = Tfunction Tnil type_int32s cc_default ->
      initial_state p (Callstate f nil Kstop m0).
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The \Ccode{initial_state} in C and Clight is a call to \Ccode{main}. It also enforces that it takes no arguments (\Coqcode{Tnil}) and returns an integer (\Coqcode{ type_int32s}).}\label{code:initial_state}
\end{table}

Second, CompCert's can't reason about programs that call \Ccode{remember} and \Ccode{incr} because their behavior depends on their internal state (the \Ccode{buff} pointer). CompCert's semantics allows calls to external calls that are assumed to be correct but unfortunately the specification of "correctness" is too strict, it assumes that the function's behavior is fully determined by (1) the state of memory, (2) the function arguments and (3) the events produced by the function. The execution of \Ccode{incr} also depends on arguments passed to a previous external call (namely, \Ccode{*p} passed to \Ccode{remember}). One could make this explicit in the event trace but CompCert events, shown in \ref{code:oldevents}, can only contain integers, floats or pointers to global variables.
 
\begin{table}\centering
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=CoqTheorem-list]
Inductive event: Type :=
  | Event_syscall: string -> list eventval -> eventval -> event
  | Event_vload: memory_chunk -> ident -> ptrofs -> eventval -> event
  | Event_vstore: memory_chunk -> ident -> ptrofs -> eventval -> event
  | Event_annot: string -> list eventval -> event
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  \begin{lstlisting}
Inductive eventval: Type :=
  | EVint: int -> eventval
  | EVlong: int64 -> eventval
  | EVfloat: float -> eventval
  | EVsingle: float32 -> eventval
  | EVptr_global: ident -> ptrofs -> eventval.
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{multicols}
\caption{The events in CompCert}\label{code:oldevents}
\end{table}

Moreover, in the CompCert semantics, the entire behavior of external functions is bundled into one big step. From looking at an execution internal steps and external function calls are uniform. This consistency is very useful when reasoning about the compilation of the program, where we want to abstract external calls. Nevertheless, when reasoning about a program in a context, it is more useful to replace the big step external calls, with their small step semantics. Regrettably, the specification of CompCert does not even guarantee that the source and target programs call the same external functions. In theory, CompCert could replace an external function call with internal steps as long as they had the same (possibly empty) trace. In practice, obviously, CompCert does not do that, but it is not exposed in its specification.

Finally, the correctness of CompCert is stated as semantic preservation theorem, where the traces are the preserved behavior. The proof of this semantic preservation, uses a forward simulation\footnote{Forward simulation and determinism of the target language implies bisimulation and thus preservation of behavior.}. We find it more convenient to expose this simulation as the specification of the compiler, deriving semantic preservation as a corollary. This way we can easily express the relation between external function calls in source and target, as simulation diagrams. Moreover, we can expose the relation between memories, in source and target. 
 
We move, then, to lift this limitations according to the following richer notion of specification  
\begin{definition}[Conjunctive compiler specification] 
We say that a compiler's specification is \emph{conjunctive} if it satisfies the following
\begin{itemize}
\item The execution of a program can start in any of its public functions and all the public functions, including \Ccode{main}, can take arguments.  
\item The execution trace supports events that can describe changes to memory. Since memory may be rearranged through compilation, wee call these \emph{memory events}.
\item There are functions \Coqcode{at_external} and \Coqcode{after_external} that describe states before and after external calls. \Coqcode{at_external} extracts the external function being called and its arguments. \Coqcode{after_external} constructs the state after the external function executes. Also, source and target languages operate over the same memory and the memory can be separated by \Coqcode{get_mem} function. We call these \emph{exposed semantics}.
\item The correctness of the compiler is stated as a forward simulation and the semantic preservation derive as a corollary. The forward simulations preserve external function calls and exposes the relation between source and target memories, throughout the execution. We call this an \emph{exposed simulation}. 
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\end{table}

In the rest of the chapter, we describe how we have improved the specification of CompCert to make it conjunctive. We first describe how to generalize \Coqcode{initial_state} to accept functions with arguments and other than main. Second we describe how to add memory events to CompCert. Then we show how to easily define exposed semantics for every language in CompCert and finally we show how to define and prove exposed simulations.  

The changes described here represent only a x\% %TODO
change to CompCert, as measured by running \Coqcode{git diff} in CompCert before and after our changes. The amount changed for every feature proposed is described in Table \ref{tab:prcntchange}.

The main ultimate goal of this thesis is to create a modular way to prove compilers safe, even in the presence of concurrency. There are already several compilers proven safe, with machine checked proofs, that give guarantees for sequential programs. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I intend to leverage those proofs and use it to give guarantees for concurrent programs.

On top of "just a compiler proof", our system is intended to be compatible with a realistic separation logic and usable on realistic machines like X86 TSO.

The main result:

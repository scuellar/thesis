\chapter{Other parts of the project} \label{ch:otherparts}

An important motivation behind the compiler correctness theorem (\autoref{ch:compiler}) is to prove the main theorem presented in \autoref{sec:topbottom:theorem}. It is what has directed many of the design decisions behind the Concurrent Permission Machine. For completeness and to expose those motivations, we present in this chapter the other parts of the top-to-bottom result, namely, the CSL correctness proof, the coarse-to-fine-graine reordering proof and the Spinlock well synchronization proof.  The bulk of the work presented in this chapter was not developed by the author so we will quote the descriptions of each part as described by their respective developers, with footnotes from the author for clarification.
